# Sorting Algo Tester

A program that compares the runtime of different sorting algorithms


## Supported Algorithms

- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Merge sort
- Quicksort
- std::sort()

## Features

- Get discription and time complexity of different algorithms
- Test individual algorithms and get runtime
- Test single algorithm many times with varying array sizes and saves results in CSV file to be plotted 



## Roadmap

- Clean up menus

- Add ability to compare 2 different algorithms

- Create plot from generated runtimes in CSV file
